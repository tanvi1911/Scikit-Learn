# What is Scikit-Learn <br>
Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

<h2>Features</h2>
Rather than focusing on loading, manipulating and summarising data, Scikit-learn library is focused on modeling the data. Some of the most popular groups of models provided by Sklearn are as follows −

**1. Supervised Learning algorithms** − Almost all the popular supervised learning algorithms, like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree etc., are the part of scikit-learn.

**2. Unsupervised Learning algorithms** − On the other hand, it also has all the popular unsupervised learning algorithms from clustering, factor analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to unsupervised neural networks.

**3. Clustering** − This model is used for grouping unlabeled data.

**4. Cross Validation** − It is used to check the accuracy of supervised models on unseen data.

**5. Dimensionality Reduction** − It is used for reducing the number of attributes in data which can be further used for summarisation, visualisation and feature selection.

**6. Ensemble methods** − As name suggest, it is used for combining the predictions of multiple supervised models.

**7. Feature extraction** − It is used to extract the features from data to define the attributes in image and text data.

**8. Feature selection** − It is used to identify useful attributes to create supervised models.

**9. Open Source** − It is open source library and also commercially usable under BSD license.
